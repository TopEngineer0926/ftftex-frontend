        </p>
        <h3>6. USE OF SERVICES</h3>

          To carry out a Digital Asset Transaction, you must follow the relevant
          instructions on the site. You authorize us to debit your E-Wallet
          before delivering Digital Assets to your Digital Asset Wallet. You may
          sell Digital Assets. You authorize us to debit your Digital Asset when
          appropriate. <br />
          6.2. Revocation
          <br />
          When you give us instructions to purchase or sell Digital Assets, you
          cannot withdraw your consent to that Digital Asset transaction.
          <br />
          6.3. Unauthorized and Incorrect Transactions
          <br />
          Where a purchase or sale of a Digital Asset is initiated from your
          E-Wallet using your credentials, we will assume that you authorized
          such a transaction unless you notify us otherwise. If you believe that
          such a transaction using your E-Wallet has been carried out without
          your authorization, or if you have reason to believe that a
          transaction using your E-Wallet has been incorrectly carried out or is
          incomplete, you must contact us as soon as possible. It is important
          that you regularly check your FTFTex wallet balance and your
          transaction history to ensure that any unauthorized or incorrect
          transactions are identified and notified to us at the earliest
          opportunity.
          <br />
          During any investigation of any actual or potential unauthorized or
          incorrect transaction, we reserve the right to suspend your account to
          avoid further losses.
          <br />
          6.4. Redeeming E-Money Deposit Orders
          <br />
          You may redeem all or part of your funds held in your E-Wallet at any
          time by selecting the appropriate option on the site and following the
          instructions. Before redeeming your funds from your E-Wallet, we may
          conduct checks for the purposes of preventing fraud, money laundering,
          terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. This may mean you are
          prevented or delayed from withdrawing funds until those checks are
          completed to our reasonable satisfaction in order to comply with our
          regulatory requirements.
          <br />
          6.5. Account Information
          <br />
          You will be able to see the balances of E-Wallet and Digital Assets.
          <br />
          6.6. Refund Rights
          <br />
          Unauthorized Transactions
          <br />
          Suppose an Unauthorized Transaction occurs as a result of our failure.
          In that case, we will refund you the amount of that transaction by no
          later than the end of the next business day after becoming aware of
          the Unauthorized Transaction and restore your E-Wallet to the state it
          would have been in had the Unauthorized Transaction not taken place.{" "}
          <br />
          Generally, you will be liable for losses incurred where: <br />
          1. The Unauthorized Transaction arises from the use of lost or stolen
          credentials when you have failed to keep the login details of your
          E-Wallet account secure), and
          <br />
          2. If you are fraudulent, or you intentionally or negligently fail to
          carry out your obligations under this Agreement, and this results in
          the Unauthorized Transactions (for example, you deliberately share
          your email and password with a third-party or are grossly negligent in
          keeping your email and password secure), you will be liable for all
          resultant losses as a result of any such Unauthorized Transactions.
          <br />
          Where there is a dispute between us and you regarding whether or not a
          transaction is an unauthorized transaction, we may temporarily credit
          your E-Wallet while we settle the dispute. Where we determine that the
          transaction was authorized, we may reverse that credit and correct
          errors made in any statement of your E-Wallet without prior notice to
          you. However, please note that during this period, your E-Wallet may
          be temporarily locked to avoid further Unauthorized Transactions. You
          will also be liable to us (as a debt) for any funds you have
          transferred, which were temporarily credited to your E-Wallet.
          <br />
          Incorrect Transactions <br />
          Should an error or action emanating from FTFTex result in an Incorrect
          Transaction, we will refund your FTFTex wallet with the transaction
          amount without undue delay and endeavor to provide you with sufficient
          notice. Should an Incorrect Transaction result in you incurring
          charges and/or interest, we will pay for those charges and/or
          interest. Should you initiate any Incorrect Transaction, we shall, on
          your request, try to trace such a transaction.
          <br />

          than FTFTex), you agree that neither we nor our affiliates or service
          providers, nor any of our directors, employees, and representatives,

          You agree to indemnify FTFTex, our affiliates and service providers,
          and each of our or their respective officers, directors, agents,
          employees, and representatives, in respect of any liabilities, losses,
          and costs (including legal fees and any fines or fees imposed by any
          regulatory authority) that have been reasonably incurred in connection
          with any claims, demands or damages arising out of or related to your
          breach and/or our enforcement of these Terms or any of our Policies,
          or your violation of any law, rule or regulation, or the rights of any
          third-party.
          <br />
          9.3. Limitations of Liability
          <br />
          FTFTex will only be liable to you for loss or damage caused directly
          and reasonably foreseeable by our breach of this Agreement, and our
          total aggregate liability to you for any individual claim or series of
          connected claims shall be limited to a maximum aggregate value of the
          combined value of the E-Funds and Digital Assets in your FTFTex
          account at the time of the relevant claim. When a specific claim

          Asset Transaction in dispute.
          <br />
          9.4. Limitation of Loss

          our or their respective directors, employees, or representatives be
          liable for any of the following types of loss or damage:
          <br />
          1. Any loss of expected or actual revenue or profits, whether directly
          or indirectly, even if we knew or should have known or were advised of
          the same possibility.
          <br />
          2. Any loss of business and/or customers and/or revenue, and/or damage
          to reputation or goodwill whether directly or indirectly, even if we
          were advised or have been made aware of such a possibility.
          <br />
          3. Any loss due to the use of data (including corrupted data),
          hardware, or software, including but not limited to any losses related
          to Digital Asset price data errors, interruptions, or delays in
          transmission of such data.
          <br />
          4. Any loss or damage whatsoever which does not arise directly as a
          result of our breach of this Agreement (whether or not you can prove
          such loss or damage).
          <br />
          9.5. Limitation of liability as permitted by law
          <br />
          The limitation of liability by FTFTex in this section is only to the
          extent permitted by the laws and regulations. In the case of gross
          negligence, deliberate misconduct, fraud, personal injury, or death
          resulting from either our or any of our subcontractors’ negligence,
          nothing in this Agreement shall limit our liability.
          <br />
          9.6. No warranties
          <br />
          To the extent permitted by law, the FTFTex services are provided on an
          "as is" and "as available" basis, with no further promises made by us
          around the availability of the FTFTex services, its suitability for a
          particular purpose, and/or non-infringement. We do not make any
          promises that access to the site, any of the FTFTex services or any of
          the materials contained therein will be continuous, uninterrupted,
          timely, or error-free.
          <br />
          We make no representations about the accuracy, order, timeliness, or
          completeness of historical Digital Asset price data available on the
          site. FTFTex cannot guarantee the processing completion duration,
          which is dependent on factors outside of our control. With respect to
          your use and access to the FTFTex services and site, you hereby
          acknowledge and agree that you have not relied on any statement or
          understanding (written or oral) except those set forth in this

          9.7. No Liability for Circumstances Beyond Our Control
          <br />
          FTFTex is not liable for any breach of the Agreement, including
          interruption of service or delays, where they arise directly or
          indirectly from abnormal and unforeseeable, and unavoidable
          circumstances beyond our control (“Force Majeure”); nor are we liable
          where the application of any mandatory legal rules have resulted in
          the breach.
